# Pre-CQI - Software Engineering

## Answer 4 - Quantitative process analysis (3 points)

a) The lifecycle used appears to be an incremental lifecycle, with iteration every four weeks. There is work on the requirements every four weeks, followed by work on the design (in the weeks that do), followed by work on implementation, followed by work on the tests (in the weeks that makes). This corresponds to waterfall style iterations corresponding to the incremental model. `(1 point)`

b) We note that very few tests were done, especially at the end of the project. Design work is also disappearing, which means that the last iterations have been intensive sessions of code work, at the expense of everything else. An iterative approach indicates feedback on requirements, which should be reflected in design and code changes, and consequent testing. The absence of this work probably indicates problems with the design, and also a lot of undetected bugs. `(1 point)`

c) I would start with an architectural quality assessment, followed by appropriate refactoring activities. Subsequently, I would add unit tests consistent with the new architecture, making the necessary corrections in the code. Eventually, I would write and run the relevant tests for the functionality of this new software. `(1 point)`
