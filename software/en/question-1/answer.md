# Pre-CQI - Software Engineering

## Answer 1 - Software Development (2 points)

a) Option b) `(0.4 points)`

b) Unit tests detect problems in a component. Integration tests detect problems during the interaction between several components. Yes unit tests and integration tests are regression tests, because if we modify some code, unit and integration tests will detect be able to determine if the code is still working. `(0.2 points)`

c) `(0.4 points)`

    IaaS: It allows companies to buy resources like networking and storage on demand, instead of having to buy expensive hardware

    IaaS Example: Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Linode, Cisco Metacloud, Digital Ocean, Vultr, Oracle Cloud

    PaaS: This platform accessible via the Internet offers developers a framework and tools to develop applications and software adapted to the needs of each company.
    
    PaaS Example: Google App Engine, OpenShift, Heroku, Force.com, Windows Azure, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce, AWS Lamda, SAP Cloud

    SaaS: These cloud application services represent the most common form of cloud computing. They are ready to use and usually run directly on the client's browser, which means there is no need for installations or downloads like on-premises solutions.
    
    SaaS Example: Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Dropbox, ZenDesk, MailChimp, Slack, HubSpot, DocuSign, Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365

d) Both offer a textual description similar to the source code that allows to instantiate part of the environment. IaC instantiates the environment in which an application is deployed in production (or during testing), while PaC instantiates the environment responsible for the release pipeline. This pipeline contains all activities related to integration, CI, testing, deployment and release, and is not visible to the end user, while the environment produced by IaC is the one in which the end user will use the app. `(0.4 points)`
