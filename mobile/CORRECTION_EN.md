# Pre-QEC 2023 - Mobile Design

## Corretion step
# Code submission
Participants are asked to submit their source code. This is to ensure that they have respected the rule of developing with a native SDK. If you know how to check this, do it. Otherwise, you can ask them during their demo which platform (iOS or Android) they developed on.

The penalty for not respecting this rule is left to your discretion.

# Demo
For this challenge, ask participants to demo their app for you. They don't have to prepare an oral presentation, they just have to show you each section of their app.

See the list of requirements and points associated with each section in `README.md` and award points according to what is there/what is missing. It is recommended that you give more points for neat/beautiful designs, but this is at your discretion.

# Screenshots
Participants are asked to submit screenshots. You can use them to complete your scoring, compare design effort between teams if you want, etc.
