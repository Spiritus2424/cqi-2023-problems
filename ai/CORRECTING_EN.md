# Pre CQI 2023 - Artificial Intelligence (10 points)


## Fix Steps
1. Ask to roll the command `python Main.py 100`
2. Note the number written next to `Average: <number-to-note> turns!`
3. Do the same for each team
4. Score the teams according to the following section


## Dots

The team with the lowest average will directly have 10 points. The rest of the teams will have a score weighted to the best team.

The total out of 10 points is calculated as follows:

$$ Total = {NbrAverageLap_{best team} \over NbrAverageLap_{team}} * 10 $$
